GWAS data sets for STOPGAP:
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

We deployed STOPGAP pipeline (https://github.com/StatGenPRD/STOPGAP) to merge and harmonize GWAS data sets from publicly
available data sources.


1. GRASP: Genome-Wide Repository of Associations Between SNPs and Phenotypes
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
Associations between SNPs and phenotypes in different disease conditions, curated by the NIH

3. GWAS DB: an update database for human genetic variants identified by genome-wide association studies
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
GWASdb is a one stop shop which combines collections of traits/diseases associated SNP (TASs) from current GWAS and
their comprehensive functional annotations, as well as disease classifications.
