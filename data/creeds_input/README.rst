CREEDS Dataset
==============
The `Jupyter notebook <https://github.com/ps4dr/ps4dr/blob/master/notebooks/creeds_loader.ipynb>`_ in the notebook directory enables you to identify experiments in the CREEDS dataset *et al* (2020) in [1]_.
Due to the large availability in type of experiments in the dataset, the notebook enables users to type a query disease/drug and conduct a search on the dataset to retrieve the best matches for the given query based on the experiment metadata. Later retrieved datasets can be preprocessed with this `R script: <https://github.com/ps4dr/ps4dr/blob/master/R/preprocessing/creeds_data_preprocessing.R>`_ before feeding them into the PS4DR workflow.
